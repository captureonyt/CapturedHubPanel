# Captured Hub

Captured Hub is an educational Roblox Lua script created for learning and exploration. It is a single, advanced library script that contains hundreds of other scripts all built in and organized within one place. Every script can be found easily using the built-in search bar, making it simple to study, learn, and experiment safely.

# About Captured Hub

Captured Hub was developed to help people understand Roblox scripting through a clean and ethical system. Instead of searching across random sources or using stolen content, everything is collected and managed inside one secure and well-structured script.

This project focuses on education, research, and responsible development. Every included script serves as an example or lesson, showing how specific systems, effects, and mechanics are made. It is meant for people who want to learn real scripting, not for exploit or unfair advantage.

# How It Works

Captured Hub runs as a single library script. Inside, hundreds of categorized scripts are stored and can be accessed by typing keywords into the search bar. The search system quickly finds what you are looking for and displays the full script for review or testing. Everything is written in clean Lua code that follows Roblox’s guidelines and best practices.

# Purpose

The main purpose of Captured Hub is to create a space where learning Roblox Lua is simple, structured, and safe. It allows developers to explore real examples without breaking any rules or copying untrusted sources. The goal is to help people grow as creators while staying completely within Roblox’s Terms of Use.
